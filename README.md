# CMake build demo

This is just a simple example to build a hello-world example, which
prints out some informations regarding used compiler and the system 
where it is running. 

This demo is used to demonstrate build automation on various platforms,
so the resulting hello-world executable is nothing more than just a 
hello-world example. ;-)

The CMake part is based on the recipes from [Dev-Cafe's CMake-Cookbook](https://github.com/dev-cafe/cmake-cookbook).
